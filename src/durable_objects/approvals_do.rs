//! Per-tenant Server-Sent Events fan-out for the approvals page.
//!
//! Each connected `/admin/approvals` browser tab opens an SSE stream that
//! routes through this Durable Object. When `approvals::enqueue` queues a
//! new draft, or any surface (Discord button, web button) resolves one,
//! the caller posts to this DO's `/broadcast` endpoint. The DO writes a
//! single SSE event to every open writer; clients re-fetch the list.
//!
//! Design notes:
//! - Singleton per tenant: id derived from `tenant_id` via `id_from_name`.
//! - In-memory only: the live writer set lives in a `RefCell<Vec<...>>` on
//!   `&self`. If the DO evicts, all SSE connections drop; the browsers'
//!   `EventSource` reconnects automatically and the new DO instance starts
//!   with an empty writer set.
//! - Event payloads are tiny pings ("data: {}\n\n"). The list HTML lives
//!   in the worker's `/admin/approvals/list` endpoint — the browser fires
//!   `hx-trigger="sse:approval-changed"` to refetch it. Keeping template
//!   logic out of the DO means the DO knows nothing about what changed,
//!   only that *something* changed for this tenant.
