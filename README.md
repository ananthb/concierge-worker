## Features

- **WhatsApp Auto-Reply**: static or AI-powered replies to every message via Meta Business API
- **Instagram DM Auto-Reply**: connect your business account, reply automatically
- **Managed Email Subdomains**: each tenant gets `*.cncg.email` addresses with smart routing rules (glob patterns). Forward, drop, AI-draft, or relay to Discord. MX records provisioned automatically via Cloudflare API
- **Discord Relay**: unified inbox. Messages from any channel land in Discord with Reply/Approve/Drop buttons. Reply in Discord and it flows back to the customer

- **Onboarding Wizard**: 5-step guided setup (business info, channels, notifications, replies, billing)
- **Notification Preferences**: configurable approval + digest delivery via Discord and/or Email with batching frequency

- **Billing**: flat prepaid credits — **₹2 / $0.02 per AI reply**, 100 free every month. Static auto-replies are always free. Buy any quantity (slider, no tiers, no packs). Email subdomains are a separate ₹199/$2 monthly subscription, auto-provisioned
- **Privacy-first**: no message content stored. Metadata only. GDPR data deletion
